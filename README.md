# UCLA 2020 Applied Maths REU Knowledge Graphs Group Repository

This is the codebase for the UCLA 2020 Applied Maths REU Knowledge Graph Group. We would
highly recommend reading our final report before looking at this codebase. This code base
contains all of our data files, traning files, and experimental code used to generate our
results during the aforementioned REU. Note that the included code is experiemental and
thus is not ready to be extended. We recommend reading through our report and then
inspecting the relevent notebooks to gain more insight on our implementations for various
tests.
